# Informed Search Algorithm Visualizer
# This script loads a graph from a text file and runs three informed search algorithms:
# Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), A* Search, and Dijkstra's Algorithm (used as CUS2).
# It prints detailed results and visualizes the path for each algorithm using matplotlib and networkx.
